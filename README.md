# Introduction to Computer Science for Biologists / 생물학자를 위한 전산학 개론

Course taken at Seoul National University in 2019 spring semester.

## Disclaimers

1. The author did not intentionally make the choice of using [Hungarian notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation) + small camel case to name variables. The author is very well aware that snake case is the canonical way to name variables in Python. It was a requirement forced by the lecturer.
2. Code reusing was not allowed by the lecturer as the submission was required to be a single file. The author is aware that some classes were defined multiple times.

## How to run

0. Clone the repo
1. Run `download_data.sh` to download the data
2. `python mission/00/Mission.py` to run the code (where you run the code is not important though)
