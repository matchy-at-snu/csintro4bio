# Mission 1

1. Perform the following analyses.

- Compute the number of mono-nucleotides and their relative frequencies in the human genome (22 autosomes only. Use unmasked sequences.)
- Compute the number of di-nucleotides, their relative frequencies, and their expected frequencies inferred from the mono-nucleotide frequencies. Indicate substantially over- or under-represented di-nucleotides if there exist.

2. Repeat the analyses for the following 4 organisms.

- Organisms Chromosomes to analyze
  - Human(hg38): 22: 1~22
  - Chicken(galGal3): 29: 1~28, and 32
  - D. melanogaster(dm3): 5: 2R, 2L, 3R, 3L, and 4
  - C. elegans(ce10): 5: I, II, III, IV, and V
